    And I load the homepage if authentication is not required
    And I start an admin session if authentication is required

    Given I navigate to a page
    Then the footer should contain the text "restful-booker-platform"

    Then the copyright notice should display "Â© 2019-<current_year>"

    Then the footer should display a "Cookie-Policy" link
    When I click on the "Cookie-Policy" link

    And the page should display the heading "Cookie Policy"
